Instructions on how to use our assembler/disassembler: 
Note: make sure to have two folders, Asmconverted and Cconverted. 
These are going to be the destination folders of the converted files.

Note 2: The assembly files to be converted to C should be placed in the Asm folder,
while the C files to be converted to Assembly should be placed in the C folder.


1) Open the jar file, and choose what type of conversion you want to execute.

2) Upon choosing between assembler or disassembler, prompt about user input for the filename will appear. 
To specify the file, only put "C\Filename.c" (if you want to convert Filename.c to asm) without the quotation marks
(or "Asm\Filename.asm" if you want to convert Filename.asm to C) in the Textfield.
Be sure to add the file extension.

example: type C\Test1.c to the Textfield to convert Test1.c to asm.

3) Hit enter and the prompt will display saying the conversion had been successful.

Note: The format of the name of the converted file has an appended prefix of 'converted' plus the name of the file used.
